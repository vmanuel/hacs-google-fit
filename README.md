Sensor is designed to be flexible and allow customization to add New Google Fit dimensions with minimal effort with relative knowledge of Python and Fitness Rest API.

## Example configuration.yaml

In order to add this component as is, add a new sensor:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: google_fit
    name: Google Fit
    client_id: your_client_id
    client_secret: your_client_secret
```

## Client ID and Client Secret

In order to generate your client_id and client_secret, see the prerequisites for Google Calender component:
<https://www.home-assistant.io/components/calendar.google/#prerequisites>
To make sensor work you have to enable Fintness API in your project.
In oder to enable Fitness API open Google cloud console: 
<https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/fitness.googleapis.com>
and enable API.

It is recommendable to store client_id and client_secret as secret as possible. You can read about it on:
<https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/secrets/>

Example:

```yaml
  - platform: google_fit
    name: Bob
    client_id: !secret google_fit_client_id
    client_secret: !secret google_fit_client_secret
```
